<h2>The History Manifesto: Best book title of the semster</h2>
<p>I’ve got to talk about Guldi and Armitage’s use of Alfred Thayer Mahan’s research in British maritime power. It seems like most of the class had some discussion over topics in their primary field of historical study, and I felt like I got mine here. Military history has been a passion of mine since I’ve taken up this history major, so I personally appreciated this in the Manifesto.</p>

<blockquote>Indeed, in at least one major subfield – military history – historians remain attached to the military schools and naval colleges that commission them to instruct future generals in strategy and international relations. Military history remains for this reason one of the last outposts of long-term history in a short-term world. Readers who care about the future may thrive on the particular detail of individual biography or battles, but generals and other strategist need the big picture on change that take centuries to be fully expressed (pg. 21).</blockquote>

</p>I plan on using this in my video project.</p> 

<h4>Extending the Mahan example</h4>

<p>As someone who is familiar with Mahan’s work and how it inspired the growth of both the American and Japanese navies pre-World War II, I saw great potential in a longue-durée format. </p>

<p>This also gave an excellent example for the use of history. I have yet to read Mahan’s work but I have been exposed to his ideas in military history courses. Mahan studied and analyzed how England – an island nation – grew into the world’s foremost naval power. I’ll spare you the complete analysis, but the argument Mahan makes is powerful, aggressive navies are important to control the sea lanes and thus control international trade.</p>

<p>Both presidents Roosevelt, along with the growing ambitious Japanese took Mahan’s example and ran with it, both growing their navies to spread outward to prosper economically. Japan especially, being an island nation like England, was resource-starved and used Mahan as a means to evolve into a world power.</p>

<p>It can be argued this also served as a contributing factor to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and thus World War II in the Pacific Theater, but Mahan’s longue-durée demonstrates the effective those lessons of the British navy – militarily speaking that is.</p>

<h4>Use of longue-durée</h4>
<p>We have discussed numerous times this semester about using history to predict the future, so I won’t go into detail there.</p>

<p>Yet, as the Mahan example showed, history can go a long way in formulating policy moving forward. I recognize the criticism that more recent phenomena means replicating past policy will not lead to the same results, but there is much to be learned from those lessons of the past. </p>

<p>Another quote I’m using for my video, this time from English historian Sir John Seeley:</p>

<blockquote>Political science without history lacks roots, and history without political science lacks fruits.</blockquote>

<p>History may not give all the answers where policy will work, but it does provide at least an understanding of how it worked in the past. It’s better than going into policy decisions blind.</p>
