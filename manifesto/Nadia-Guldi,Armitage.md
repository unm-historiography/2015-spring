Guldi and Armitage spend a great amount of time on the advent of big data and how it has revolutionized, among other things, the field of history. Scholars now have more access to documents and other information than ever before. However, this begs the question of whether or not there is a limit to a historianâ€™s responsibility to seek out all possible sources. This was something that was briefly brought up in class the other day, but it is worth giving further thought to. At what point can historians safely say that they have done enough research? If we are responsible for analyzing all the information available to us, then I feel like we become slaves to the process of finding information. Throughout the chapter dealing with big data, Guldi and Armitage focus more on the positive effects that the Age of Information has on scholarship, like the digitalization of primary sources and the ability to search keywords. 

Overall, I liked this book. It is extremely relatable because it was recently written and thus deals with familiar topics in a way that is relevant to us. It also addresses one particular question that all the previous authors shied away from: what use is history? Sure, Guldi and Armitage only focus on a few practical applications for historical thinking but at least they tried answering it. If anything, this is the beginning of a new conversation in which this question gets discussed and the debate can shed more light on the benefits of history!
