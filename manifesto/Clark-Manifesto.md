#### Maybe the Best Book From This Semester!

  1. **A Full Throated Defense of History**

  The authors, Guldi and Armitage, see history in a similar way that I do. History isn't science, and it was a folly of previous historiographers, like Bloch and Carr, to every try assert that it was, because in some ways it's better. History unites the social sciences, it is the polar oppisite of the hardest of hard sciences. But, that doesn't mean that History can't use some influence from modern compuer science, specifically big data. This is all something I thouroughly believe, and I'm proud to report that this book seems to as well. 
  
  2. **Micro Histories? Who needs them. 
  
  While not a exact qoute from the manifesto, it might as well be. But, again, this is a sentement that I generally agree with. Microhistories, to me, are important for digging under the surface on generally under-researched topics. But, they are also a little boring and lack the scope that I think actually adds to greater understanding of larger trends in the march of history for all but the most knowledgeable readers. 

  3. **Did The Author Have to Get Political?
  
  I am on the same side as them on the topics like climate change and everything, but I was surprised that the authors would wade into the sad culture war that is climate change to make points in a book about historiography. It felt unnescessary, and even distracting. I agree with big data, and all that, but I don'e see how it helping people understand and solve climate change would help historiography, besides the general development of software and hands on use, but are historiographers also studying climate change using the same saftware? I'm not sure....It was a metophor used throughout the whole book too, strange.
