<p><b>"Historians of the world, unite!"</b></p>
<p>I really appreciated this novel. It came full circle and each point was tied together at the end. I could also easily relate it 
to specific studies on mine thus far in college. The authors discuss history and its relation to scientific data collections and
make the arguement that historians play a unique role in determing data. I agree with this point that historians do add a large 
component to understanding scientific, ecological, and political data. Historical text and scientific data go hand in hand. 
They use the example of using text for determining data. Like what food people were eating, what techniques people were using 
to gather their food, and what state the food sources were in, and how each can be telling of the environment during that 
time and why there were perhaps rises in populations, or widespread famine in others.
The use of data and data collections can be extremely telling of the past as well as of the future. Taking mass amounts of
"big data" create trends and can be very fortelling.</p>
<p>The discussion of big data in history reminded me of some of my anthropology classes. In these classes we took artifacts of the past
and used soil analysis to determine why each artifact was there, when it was placed there, and what it meant for those who lived
during that time. For example, recently we looked at a grouping of ancient bones that had been burnt by fire. 
Through scientific data we were able to see that the fire that burnt the bones had burned too hot for it to have been natural. 
The fire exhibited evidence that the fire had been man made and spawned the hypothesis for when man-made, controlled fire, was first used. 
I could easily relate this example in anthropology to what the authors were discussing in the novel. In this example though
it is more about how data has shaped history rather than how historians shaped data.</p>
<p><b>"...long-term histories of land water use have become increasingly precise in their accounts of where ecological stress has 
happened before, why, and how it has become overcome."(66)</b></p>
<p> Guldi and Armitage give the example of how scientists and data collectors look towards historians in determing the myths and/or
hypotheses about why the data is the way it is. Historians in their opinion tie the data together.</p>
