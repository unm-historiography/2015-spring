__So I take back my  remarks about this book not being melodramatic__

The sections on micro histories were very dramatic. They were basically saying that micro histories are the end of history. They say...

>“If long-term historical thinking is to fulfill the promise we have proposed for it here, then we will need a rubric >for thinking big with adequate skill and historical finesse. What constitutes a critical eye for looking at long-term stories? What characteristics unite the models that we choose? How would a classroom training young minds to think far back and far forward in time operate? (118)” 

Here they are question the historical education system. These are rhetorical questions, to make the author think and question their own stance on the debate. It is a good method but again after this section it just gets more and more dramatic. Which made them loose authority in my mind. I do think that they pose good questions, and for students to be able to look far back in a rhetoric of time. But details are important, because details help answer causation, and that was another issue that the authors tried to correct. 

__One good thought__

I liked their ideas on treating macro histories like we treat micro histories. It makes sense, but I do not think that it would work as easily as they made it sound to be. My favorite sections started after...

>“The first flickering of a revolution in using macroscopic data to look at the big picture is beginning to show on >the horizons of some of the world’s research universities, where interest in government-collected data has prompted a resurgence of cliometrics, which refers to the study of History (embodied by the Greek muse, Clio) through the history of things that can be quantitatively measured – wealth, goods, and services that were taxed and recorded, and population (165).” 

__So from what I understood is that we should but micro histories into different forms of data, then use the data to make connections in the bigger picture.__ This makes sense, but I really do think that we need to expand more on micro histories to understand the bigger picture. Which is why the section on causation, it made a lot less sense to me then the sections on data. They made it seem like it is simple finding causation, when it is really not, we have talked about how causation and my understanding it that it is a lot more complicated then these two authors made it out to be. 

__Over all I found this section okay__
* The only part I really like was the part about using data to find the bigger picture, they made is clear and simple
- I really didn't like the dramatic tone they used “pointless” micro-histories. 
+ and I thought that their thoughts on causation were weak.
