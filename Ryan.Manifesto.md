  I love the ideals that authors portray: how big data is very impartial and objective. And how everything will eventually be consoldated sounds great in theory but what elements of subjectivity and emotional attachment to a particular historical event or place/space do we lose by condoning this? It takes me back to what we read on De Certeau on the distinction between place and space. If we become so impartial and objective by looking at large chunks of data, then what good is place or space? It takes away the whole idea of a certain place or space meaning something very individual to a certain person. In a sense it is limiting the ideas. 
  
  Perhaps the most important argument of the book is that temporality matters. It matters if we think short or long term, and, more subtly, it matters that we think of the issues The History Manifesto dubs as “crises” which we must look to “before it’s too late”. 
  
  “Historians can never shake off the element of time. It clogs and drags our studies, but it also defines them. It is the soil through which we dig, the element from which history itself springs”
