Bloch uses this section of his book to discuss the difficulties that can face a historian. He discussed the need to be impartial and classifications of events and of people. Block also discussed what is crucial to the telling of an event. He talks about how linguistics and how the differences between cultures and time can impact understandings he also discussed cross discipline differences how why and integrating them. Bloch also maintains understanding of the human element. Some of the key word I took from this section were Capitalism feudalism revolution and histories have and have notâ€™s.
