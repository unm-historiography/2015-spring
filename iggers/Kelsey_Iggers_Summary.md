As detailed in the first half of Iggers, the main differences between historians of the 19th century and mythical historians
is that 19th century historians recognize the science in history. This main difference sets the ground work for historians 
such as Ranke to detail his "history as science" philosophy.
There are similarities however, similarties which still continue to be true in 20th century history.
1. They accepted a correspondence theory of truth. This theory portrays people and events as actually occurring in history.
2.Human actions mirror the intentions of the actors. This thus marking the task of the historian to comprehend these intentions,
place them in chronological order and construct a story.
3. Operating with a one-dimensional conception of time in which events appear coherently. 
Historical thought in the 20th century can be identified in two
different orientations.
1. The transformation of the kind of narrative, event-orientated history as seen in historical social science.
2. Various methodological and ideological historical approaches.
The first Chapter spends a great deal of time focusing on Ranke and history as both a scientific and social discipline,
serving both public and political needs. The "Revolution from Above" Iggers terms it, referring to the new model for historical
scholarship. Ranke believes that history revealed meaning and that meaning revealed itself only in history. Referring to this as
the "crisis of historicism" Ranke and Iggers argue that historical scholarship had lost its relevance. 
In the next few chapters Iggers details the public's preference for narrative and political history, the kind that centers on 
events and great people of the past. In pursuit of making history more professional and scientific Iggers discusses the German
tradition of economic and social history, the forms of social science in the U.S, the French Annales School and the 
reconstitution of social history in Germany. He refers to these important examples of historical thought to argue his concept
of social science in the 20th century.
