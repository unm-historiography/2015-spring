<h2>Summary over first two parts of Iggers's "Historiography in the Twentieth Century"</h2>
<p> Essentially, the first part of this book breaks down the history of historiography. It provided a recap from earlier this semester.</p>
<h5>Part 1: Social science approach</h5>
<ul>
<li>Recapping Ranke: He developed the notion of objectivity in historical pursuits in order to establish credibility. In Ranke's view, objectivity is key.</li>
<li>Pursuit of history as a social science.</li>
<li>Rankean approaches proliferate.</li>
<li>Historical sociology begins to grow in Germany. "The question remained how the human or cultural sciences such as historical studies research could proceed from unique phenomena to broader social and historical context." (Pg. 37).</li>
<li>American traiditon also focused on social sciences. Example: examining the railroad and American economic growth.</li>
<li>Americans at this time tended to see themselves as a classless society and without ideological conflicts (the Civil War notwithstanding), and this impacted their historical approaches in a more scientific way.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Part 2: Challenges of social science approach</h5>
<ul>
<li>Focuses heavily on describing the <i>Anneles</i> school.</li>
<ul>
<li>It's an opposing force to the Ranke model, focuses on everyday person.</li>
<li>It's not lineary, and it abandons Western superiority ideal and causality focus.</li>
<li>Sources used: symbols, language, artifacts, anthropological elements.</li>
</ul>
<li>Less politically driven, moves away from Marxist linear progress ideas.</li>
<li>Iggers quoting Ranke: History has replaces philosophy</li>
<ul>
