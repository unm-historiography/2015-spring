<p> 1. Iggers uses the term "Revolution from above" in describing the changes being made to historical scholarship. With this model, 
he argues that histroy is taking on a more social science-like appearance. Do you agree with this? Why?</P>
<p> 2. Iggers refers to the "crisis of a historian" as being the loss of relevance to historical scholarship. Do you think there
is a crisis at hand for historians? </p>
<p> 3. Iggers makes the claim that people are not as interested in history anymore because it is becoming more of a social science
and less of a narrative. Which type of history to you agree with/ like more?
