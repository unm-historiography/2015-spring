This was one of my favorite readings of the class. I also liked that it was referenced in Clark and even with the term "geertismo." 

I think Geertz and his method of extrapolating the macro from the micro are apt, but perhaps my favorite thing about Geertz is that in his article, he was actually there. I like it when history meets investigative journalism, and wish there was more of this trend in history. It mainly comes from anthropologists. I understand that if you're writing about the civil war, you can't exactly travel there... but there is something to be said of at least going to the battlefields you are writing about and injecting things like imagery into a historical piece. 

What really struck me with Geertz is how he started his article almost as a short story and immediately caught my attention. 

I don't think it applies in every case, but his methods of formulating broader meaning from the small micro is one of my favorite methods i read about in this class. I prefer history with anthropological insight, and my personal preference after this course is a blend of macro and micro history, anthropology, with a flavor of historiography in there as well -- written with almost a literature type voice.
