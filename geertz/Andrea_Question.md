In Geertz article he tells us in great detail about the cockfighting traditions in Bali. He outlines many of the rules and operations of the cockfights and also goes into detail about the handlers and the great deal of care and respect they provide their cocks with. Geertz recounts his participation at a cockfight and declares it to be the event that gained him access to the community. His choice to run from the police was an act of solidarity with the community. Geertz later explores a deeper analysis of these cockfights and dissects the deeper social meanings. He constructs for us the need in Bali social structures for the symbolic cockfights. These fights serve to alleviate tensions and solve social problems in the communities without voicing of conflict between persons or groups. Through a complex system of betting the fights are integrated with status and allow the Balinese people to show solidarity and through cockfighting.  This was a shift from many of the readings that we had done and at first I was really confused about why we were reading it but as we got further into the course and Geertz deep play was frequently mentioned I became comfortable with the ideas of mixing anthropology and history even more.
