<p>For my video I would like to explore linguistics and their relationship to history.</p>
I would like to use various examples showing mistakes made by historians due to the use of different languages and 
cultures in historical text. The point I would like to make is how important culture and language are to history 
and why it is pertinent for historians to understand specific cultures before they take on the task of discussing them.
I am still in the process of researching but I would like to pull from Clark's section on linguistics.
