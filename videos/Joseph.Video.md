I would like to use a video to explore the boundary between history and literature. 

I would also like to focus on literature based on history primary sources and turned into movies. E.g., Ibn Fadlan's journey to russia -> Michael Chriton's Eaters of the Deat -> The Antonio Banderas movie "13th Warrior." essentially, how primary sources are adapted through literature and ultimately through film.
