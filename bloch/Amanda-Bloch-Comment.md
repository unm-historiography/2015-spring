Throughout The Historian’s Craft, Bloch seems to have a particular interest in how certain words are interpreted throughout history and through a historian’s research. Bloch tends to discuss terminology and its changing meanings overtime. He states that he does not find these changing definitions to be troublesome but that the feelings that go along with these words are what can cause “inconveniences” in trying to write history (170-171). Bloch expresses frustration about how certain terms are mistakenly used interchangeably or oppositely (he discusses feudal system seigneurial system confusion on page 171) and that historians have a responsibility to correctly understand and fix these mistakes. 

In addition to his concern about misunderstanding terminology, or changing definitions, Bloch also concerns himself with information lost in translation. A quote on page 162 reads, “For to choose an equivalent is to postulate a resemblance.” Out of this entire chapter, this quote stood out the most to me because it reminds me of science, which he often refers to, and how cells are constantly recreating cells and making copies of copies and as the process progresses information is lost and cells deteriorate. The same could be said for a historical document that is being translated. If it is translated from one language, to another, and then to another, words could be used that ‘resemble’ what the original text said in its original language and after a few translations the original meaning may be lost. 

Another approach to history that concerns Bloch is the 100 year chunk of time that some historians refer to as ‘centuries.’ This approach is bothersome to Bloch because not all historically significant events happen between the ‘01 to the ’99—or ’00—years of any century. His example of this is that what people generally refer to as 12th Century Renaissance history actually began in 1060 (p. 182). If for some reason a historian begins research in 1101, those forty years are forgotten about when studying the 12th Century Renaissance and those forty years are significant.

The reason that Bloch focuses so much on causes of history instead of effects is because, as he repeatedly states in his book, historians will find more information about an event if he/she always asks why something happened and to work backwards from any given main event. In the last line of the book, Bloch summarizes his advice to historians clearly, “…Causes are not to be assumed, they are to be looked for…”
