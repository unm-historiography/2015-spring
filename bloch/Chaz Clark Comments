I feel that the author's main point here is to try to keep human biases away when studying history. 
Stay impartial, stay on point, and stick to the facts. Try to get in the mind set of the time period being studied 
because it is easy to allow a more modern mind with modern thoughts and ideals to dictate your critical thinking skills. 
By doing this you allow time and history to be viewed as a continuum versus set points in time. 
Viewing and studying history this way allows humans to see the evolution of humans and human interaction in a 
clearer more seamless way. This can help with dealing strictly with the raw material and help you delve into the meat of a 
situation instead of dealing solely with the main point. 

He mentions language as being a big obstacle when studying history. It is very easy to misunderstand or misinterpret. 
Different slang is used at different times in history and different types of people used different words and phrases. The 
author warns us to be carful and tread lightly, but it's apart of the job.
