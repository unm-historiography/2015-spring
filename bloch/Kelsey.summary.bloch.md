The Historian's Craft can be viewed as a sort of guidline for a historian to follow when documenting an event. 
The second half of this novel focuses on the particulars which go into composing an adeqaute hisotrical analysis.
Bloch describes a historian's analysis as a depicting of understood events. The historian is to simply tell the tale but 
should remain as impartial as possible. Bloch notes that this a skill that is merely impossible as it is human nature to judge.
A historian who attempts to be "black and white" as Bloch puts it, misses the underlying circumstances of human reality.
The task therefore shifts from merely stating the facts to making accusations and hypotheses of them. When forming these
hypotheses it is common for a historian to let prior emotions and predjudices affect him. As Blcoh notes,"Whenever judgment 
leans to one side we cannot help distorting and twisting the narative in this direction." 
A historian must lay aside his own ego in order to tell that of another person. Understanding is a key word for historians 
as understanding is a necessity in analyzing a historical event or circumstance. The raw information of history must be
first understood and then organzied. Bloch compares the organizing of such material to a phenomenon or experiment of science. 
Bloch sees history as a science, including both subject matter and man; to neglect one would be to "deny time."
It is the business of a historian to be always testing his classifiations in order to justify the existence of them.
Despite all historians and their attempts to encompass reality, each starts at a different vantage point than the subject.
A historian must start by dissecting the particular circumstances and find out what beliefs, prejudices,
and economical and policital affairs underly the events. By isolating such facts and languages, the facts will stand out
more clearly.
