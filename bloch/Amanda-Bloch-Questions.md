**Questions I remember having after reading Bloch**

If history=inquiry what kind of questions would Bloch have used when approaching a new text? Did he have general inquiries about each new set of data or did he create questions as he read through the document. Also, for newer historians, are there bad/meaningless questions to ask when faced with a new text/document?

If historians look for ‘tracks’ can people in the present deliberately leave tracks for historians in the future or would they be dismissed as irrelevant since they were deliberately left, would there be too much bias left in that particular track? Or, can tracks even be left on purpose, are they accidentally left? Does causality have everything or nothing to do with tracks left by man?
