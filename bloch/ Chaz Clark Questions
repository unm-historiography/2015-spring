1.) Biases are a part of human nature and are extremely difficult to turn on and off. Biaes are what create the history we know
and study today. Without biases religions wouldn't exist in the way they do today, racism may not have been as extreme which in
turn may have caused the Civil War to never exist. Biases are important to human interaction. Therefore, my question is
is attempting to stiffle such a natural human experience such as showing bias, is it allowing the study of history to fully 
comprehend the humans at the time being studied?

2.) My second questions is related to my first. Is it even possible to be completely unbias. If not (the more likely answer) 
does it affect your studies to the point of being unusable? Having biases towards a few things and not towards others would 
clearly impact your thoughts and studies in some way. Is this okay? How do you avoid this?
