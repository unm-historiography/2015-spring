+<b><h3>Comments of Carr's Chapters</p></h3>
Cause and effect is a major theme in these chapters. Humans learn from every interaction they have whether positive of negative. 
This would suggest that history would never repeat itself because if it happened and it eneded with a bad result, humans would 
have learned from this and wouldn't allow it to happen again. But I would argue that this is not always the case. Humans 
have learning curves with anything they do and history shows this. Wars get more advanced and slavery is no more, but 
it took a few tries. But by studying history, and seeing what humans have tried in the past will give us a better chance as a 
society to not repeat the bad parts.
