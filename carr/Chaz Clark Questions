+<b><h3>Questions Based Off Carr's chapters</p></h3>
1.) Carr's idea that a historians job is a science poses the question: are historians and psychologists more similar than they 
seem on the surface since they both deal with humans? 

2.) A good part of humans is the ability to critically think and choose which information we let sink in versus discard. 
This ability creates the sense of indiviualism that Carr touches on. Wouldn't having so many opinions and indivdual 
ideas and thoughts create complications with historians? Wouldn't having so many ideas make it difficult to know which 
ones to trust?
