<b><h3>Summary of Carr's fourth and fifth chapters</p></h3>
<p>•	Carr stresses the importance of causes in the study of history, balancing the why with the how.</p>
<p>•	He points to several causes assigned to events, and a historian’s job is the reduce those causes into a hierarchy to identify “the cause of all causes.”</p>
<p>•	Work must be done through simplification and through multiplication of causes.</p>
<p>•	Carr mentions determinism is not strictly a problem of history, but all human behavior. Humans act because of causes. For example, an acquaintance isn’t likely to scream profanity at you without some particular reason.</p>
<p>•	Do not assume inevitability, Carr says. For an event to happen a difference way, the antecedent cause must be different.</p>
<p>•	Carr refutes the importance of accidents. He does not completely disregard their existence, but he minimizes the role they play.</p>
<p>•	He focuses heavily on the cause-and-effect approach to history. How can anyone sequence cause and effect if it’s liable to be broken by accidents?</p>
<p>•	These “so-called accidents,” as Carr puts it, aren’t really accidents but rational should be rationally explained and fitted into the broader pattern.</p>
<p>•	There is no rigidity between “historical” and “unhistorical.”</p>
<p>•	Carr uses a car accident as an example: A man who had too many drinks drives a car with bad breaks, turns at a blind corner and kills a stranger walking to the store to buy cigarettes. How important is the fact the stranger ran out of cigarettes? Where does that rank in the hierarchy?</p>
<p>•	Regarding progress, Carr refers to Enlightenment thinkers, with history becoming progress toward the goal of perfection of man’s estate on earth.</p>
<p>•	Evolution vs. progress: the timetable is different. I.e., man is capable of much broader lines of thought now without the brain evolving larger.</p>
<p>•	There is no finite start or end to progress. Even with some periods of regression, Carr advocates there is always progress.</p>
<p>•	He calls historiography a “progressive science.” The future is the key to understanding the past, he says.</p>
<p>•	This whole chapter, and really the whole book, seems to be Carr trying to come to grips about what happened with Hitler’s rise in power and moving forward from World War II, almost trying to prevent such a war in the future.</p>
<p>•	He declares faith in future society and faith in the future of history.</p>
