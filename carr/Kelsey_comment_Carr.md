<p>"But I shall venture to believe that the historian who is most conscious of his own situation is also more capable of transcending it,
and more capable of appreciating the essential nature of the differences between his own society and outlook and those of other
period and other countries..."</P>
<p>This quote resonated with me on the task of a historian. Mostly because it seemed to be the clearest definition of what makes
a historian a good historian. This quote to me meant that the task of historian is to be objective in his (or her) task, 
to remain aware of the current mood and opinions that he or she might harbor and attempt to press forward in creating historical
perspective/ narrative. It is crucial for a historian to attempt to remain objective and aware of the possible feelings that might
affect that objectivity. Is history that is not objective, truly history? Sure it is. But in my opinion its not the truest of
histories. Or maybe it is, simply because it shows the views of the current culture through the perspective of the historian.This
is just me being philisophical however, back to the novel...</P>
<P> Carr goes on to make the statement that a great historian asks the question "why?" but about new things, rather than asking
"why?"about things that have already been asked. History is typically the art of finding cause and effect. But like Carr points
out, that cause and effect is often up for discussion. I do not understand what is different about finding the cause and effect
of new things versus old if they are always going to be debated. If history is truely a science then wouldn't these determinations
be set in stone such as those defined cause and effect relationships in science? Carr also mentions that history begins with
the handing down of tradition and the carrying on of habit and lessons of the past.(142) Is this not asking the "why" question 
about old things? Perhaps I am just confused about the points that Carr is trying to make. Regardless, he is proving to be very
redundant.
