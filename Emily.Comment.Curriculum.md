###How Should The History Curriculum Change?

####Thinking About Time Takes Time

I’m coming to realize that most people are entirely disconnected with the passing of time, and history is essentially seen as one congealed mass of ‘old’. Stonehenge, the pyramids, roman artifacts, and Westminster castle do not occupy their own unique places in history, but are indistinguishable members in this community of ‘old’.  Why is this? Well, it is partly because people have lost touch with the past, and do not take the time to actually contextualize historical information. History consequently turns into a vast expanse of nothing in particular very quickly. Is there anyway this can be changed? I’m glad you asked, because there might be something that can be done. 

####Some Things That Should Change

#####1. It’s not all about the facts
The two years of history that I took in high school were identical: read the textbook, take notes on the textbook, take a test. History was the process of memorizing facts, and then proving that you had memorized them. But this turns history into a giant timeline whose only purpose is to be memorized. After reading Bloch and Carr who address the historical fact and what this is, we come to realize that facts are not as concrete as we were once taught to believe. It is because of this that I believe the history curriculum would improve if we taught ideas as opposed to facts, and to study time and moments in the past as the intersections of place (think de Certeau), people, and documents. Time helps us to talk about history, but history is not merely time. 

#####2. Primary Sources: Use Them
I didn’t start handling primary sources in history until I was in University. Why should students be exempt from reading primary sources until so late? They should not be. Primary sources should also not be restricted only to documents. Include artwork, images, and maybe even some data (not exactly primary sources, but still valuable).

#####3. Unused information is not a waste 
School curriculums place so much value on end products, whether that is papers or test scores, and neglect the learning process to get there. What I’ve come to realize is that most of the information I gather from research is not used in a paper or tested on an exam, which for most people encourages them only to research and learn the absolute minimum required. Things like annotated bibliographies and book reviews are a good way to value and encourage wider research and learning that isn’t always incorporated into a paper or exam.

#####4. There are other ways to share information 
While on the topic of papers and exams, these should not be the only ways of evaluating learning. Other presentation forms, like a one page visual diagram or video, should be used to present information. Some research topics lend themselves better to these other forms of expression, and writing should not always be more valued.
