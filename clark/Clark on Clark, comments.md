#### Clark, my name sake, Does a Good Job

**Context Matters**

Chapter 7 may be the best of all the chapters we read throughout the semester. It deals with context, and how important that is for researching and understanding history. I feel context is something that is so often overlooked in todays teaching of history adn the laymans understanding of history.

But, the question is, how does the author know the context that a particular historical document was written in, and how does he show that to the reader without putting his own new spin on that context, and possibly changing it? This is something that Clark goes into when she talks about LaCapra and his contextualism. While it doesn't talked about at length, it is discussed. How can a context ever be know? it is almost as illusive as complete historical truth, in some ways its much greyer. Where complete historial truth is a collection of facts, complete contexctual understanding is so nuanced. 

Either way, I feel searching for proper context in historial research, writting, and reading is basically the most important part, besides the basic facts being mostly accurate. and even though it is hard to find that contextual truth, Clark is right in calling fo it. To me, this was the most interesting and important part of this book, chapter 7.
