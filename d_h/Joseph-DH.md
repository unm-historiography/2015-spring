I agree with Emily, the design of this book needs vast improvement. 

Perhaps it would be better suited, rather ironically, for graphic video format.

The content was rather weak, IMO, as well. Most of it is already common knowledge. For a while everyone has known about a push into the digital world. 

But anyway, throughout the assigned pages I wondered if there's a new digital environment for literature. Like, a move towards more short stories that are animated on video and narrated to the reader by the author. Or even if history lecture's will adapt to a Lawrence Lessig type template of presentation that harnesses the capability of the communicative power of digital.

Lawrence Lessig, IP activist in the digital age and Professor of IP Law at Harvard, does a great job discussing the new boundries in the digital world. I think a lot of what he talks about shows up in this book, only that he talked about it over 10 years ago. He also added the legal ramification's, his primary focus, into the mold as well. Anyway, this book is relatively recent yet it's not really saying anything novel. 

This did give me a greater respect towards the creative use of digital media in studies such as History, however.

The most interesting bit I found so far was about the polymath's. Professor's in history will probably have to become not only more well versed in other area's of study, but also in the scope of technology.
