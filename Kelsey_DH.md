<p>Let me preface this comment by noteing that I am a fan of digialized text for the sole reason of its easy accessibility.
I think that the internet has made it incredibly easy to locate information about the past, present, and future. The internet
is how I stay updated on what is currently going on in the world. I will sit down with a cup of coffee and an online news source 
before I will ever pick up an edition of the morning newspaper. 
Now with that being said, I am more of a fan of books, especially when it comes to historical information. I have always liked books.
As a child I would sit in my father's library and read history book after history book. I loved the texture of the pages,
the way the book felt in my hands, the smell of the pages, the content, I loved it all. 
Even now that I live in my own in a small apartment, one which lacks room for many books, I keep a collection of historical texts and novels.
Even just looking at them makes me happy. I cannot do that with the internet. Once I've read an internet
text, it disappears. Even if I were to print it out in hard copy form, it would just simply not be the same.
Burdick et al. talks about digitalizing sources of all humanities for the purpose of keeping up with the 
21st century and educating the general population.</p>
<p>"The social, political, and ecological challenges of the 21st century demand significantly more than textual analysis or 
recitations of inherited content." p.25.</p>
<p> Burdick et al. is right. The 21st century is technologically growing at a rapid pace. More people are relying on the internet
rather than books. The trends of the world are digital. Burdick et al. is right in saying that humanities needs to move to more digital
forms if it is going to keep up. However, this is all said with the assumption that the entire world is following this process.
Not all people use the most modern of technologies or rather even have access to it. Technology and digital forms of things are
expensive. I think that humanities can find a happy middle. Remain textual for those who have easier access to it or if they are
like me, prefer it. And move to digital forms for those who are technologically advanced. This would require more work on
authors and composers of these texts though, but I think that it would have the best out come in the long run. Like Burdick mentioned,
the goal is to educated the population. What better way than to make accomadations for the whole? </p>
<p> Now to talk about the books appearance. I did not like it.</p>
<p> I mentioned earlier that I enojyed the way books felt and looked. I did not enjoy this one. It felt to me like more of a
"coffee table" book than library, educational book. I might have enjoyed it more if it weren't such an odd size with odd text.
Also, the bolded words throughout the text distracted me. It were as if Burdick et al. had already pointed out the most
imporant point worth reading. I was more drawn to those words- for a reason it seems- but in educational texts I do not want
to be told what the author thinks is imporant. Unless of course I were to be tested on it. But in this case there is no test,
so I do not want to know what the author thinks I should know. I would rather find the key points myself and what points
seem interesting or important to me. But maybe that's just a personal preferace. Burdick et al. spends an entire section on
visualization and data design. The authors have done their research on what catches the attention of readers. This is not it.</p>
