#### Humanities 

So I mentioned once that there should be a general humanities degree, one that includes Arch, Anth, Phil, Hist, Poly Sci, Socio, etc and is comprised of a 54 hour upper division double major. Some said this was called a liberal arts school like St Johns; however, I spoke with my roommate from St John’s about this and he said it’s not that at all. 

At St John’s, for instance, they study primary source literature and philosophy in the era they are studying in order to contextualize that periods history. They don’t study Arch, Poly Sci, etc. They curriculum is geared towards studying concepts of beauty and truth with an end game towards studying the molecule. 

#### History major/‘Digital’ minor 

But, I am in the camp that thinks the modern historian should be a polymath, so I understand that there should be a potential for if you want to study JUST history as a degree you should look to have an edge by pairing the BA with a computer design/digital minor. 

I think there are three primary types of people who choose a history BA path. The future historian. The future law school student. The student who doesn’t know what to study so they choose history because it’s interesting and some employers may look favorably on their resume because of the skills history advances. 

I think for each of these groups, skills in the digital realm would be a boon. 

#### On the other hand 

I don’t know how the PhD curriculum is set up in history but these technological nuances might also be better reserved for future practicing historians/teachers/professors. 

I kind of liked the curriculum as the way it is now. Adding a bunch of math and computer classes and taking away from upper division history courses might be counter intuitive to an aspiring historian or just someone who studies history because they find it interesting. 

As of now, I think there are 8 upper division history courses required. If you take away from that, which is already low IMO, you’re taking away from the student’s repository of which the student can compose their ideas into digital. Each upper division history course I have taken as changed my view of history. If I had only taken 4, my historical perspective might be too limited to make a good judgement call as to if I wanted to pursue a grad degree in that subject. 

The only thing I think I'm sure of, as far as tweeking, is two fold. 
1) I don't agree with changing the lower division course. I think getting into micro before macro is getting the cart before the horse. 
2) I do think that this class, being the last history class in my path, was getting the horse before the cart. I think this class would be better served as a pre-req for upper division humanities. I also wish there was a class like this in literature, econ, etc.
