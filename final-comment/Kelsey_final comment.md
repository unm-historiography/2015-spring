<p>I enjoyed this class as it was a fresh change to the type of history that I have been used to doing my entire schooling career.
This class has opened my mind to history and has left me with a more enlightened view on how I, as a historian, should attempt to
do history. This being said, I now how more questions about history and historical content that I have ever had before. I once
thought that because a historian wrote about it, that it had to be truthful. I know understand how naive this made me.</P>
<p><b>I liked...</b></p>
<p>how this class was structured. I felt both comfortable to discuss my opinions but yet pressured to be intelligent in those opinions.
I enjoyed the intelligent conversations we had in this class and as result I feel that I have grown as a student and historian.
The material of this class was difficult for me as I had never been exposed to it before but as result I feel that it benefited me
and encouraged me to learn outside of my conformt zone. I feel silly saying that, as isn't that the point of classes, to push you
out of you comfort zone with new information? But with this class, being a history class, it was different. Being a history
major, history is obviously my thing. This class took that and some how managed to make me doubt that history is actually my thing. 
Nevertheless, I enjoyed this class.</P>
<p><b>I didn't like...</b></p>
<p>the repitive and philisophical concepts. But that is just because I do not do well with philosphy. I like concrete concepts.
Which is why I like history. History is concrete, or at least I thought so...until I took this class...</p>
<p><b>How I think the history curriculum should be changed<b></p>
<p>I think that the history curriculum should be changed to be less date and name giving and more narrative based. We discussed 
earlier that history is taking a turn away from narratives. I like history in narrative forms. It makes it real and exciting.
If history was made to be more exciting I feel that more people would be interested in learning it. With this being said though,
we also discussed how historians have a problem with those in other fields not giving history creditability.Narratives
can sometimes make history seem more like story telling and less like a social science. Perhaps if historians 
and history classes made the uses of history more apparent, more people would find it creditable. We also talked about having historians
take classes in other fields to be more well-rounded (and job worthy). I do not agree with this. Bio-chem majors don't have to take
extra classes in history to make them well-rounded, so why should we? There will always be places for historians as there will always
be places for bio-chem majors. There are certain classes that are relevant to someone's future and certain classes that just aren't. 
Historians most likely are not trying to get into fields that deal with irrelevant information to their future jobs.
