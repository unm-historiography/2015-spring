<h2>J.R.'s final comment</h2>
<p><i?First off, a disclaimer: I am writing this in a fog of illness and exhaustion. I apologize if it comes across as rambling.</i></p>

<p>With that out of the way, as we close a semester in this course, I can’t help feeling I have more questions than answers about the value of history. Some things I feel more solid about, others I can’t completely shake.</p>

<h4>On history as a guidepost to the future</h4>
<p>This question in particular, I have gone back and forth on. There is no predicting the future with 100 percent accuracy. I think we can all agree on that. Just because events happened a certain way in the past doesn’t necessarily mean that they will transpire exactly the same way in the future. Certain societal and cultural factors play a part in events, some of those may not have been there previously.</p>

<p>Yet I can’t completely remove historical context when trying to develop policy. Take appeasement for example. Appeasement was a fairly regular foreign policy prior to Hitler’s reign in the 1930s, but Neville Chamberlain’s “peace in our time” speech proved to be false because Hitler spread into Poland and kicked off World War II. An appeasement policy most likely won’t be used in the future because it failed so miserably, but Europeans 20 years prior just finished a world war that devastated the population. When taken into context, it makes sense why Chamberlain would pursue appeasement to prevent another war.</p>

<p>So how valuable is history for policy-making? It can be, it may not be. History can serve the purpose to provide guideposts to illustrate how events transpired and if those events are repeating, but historians also provide the context what makes the events in the past different than the events in the future.</p>

<h4>On curriculum</h4>
<p>I have absolutely no idea how to change the way history is taught. I’m just going to leave it at that.</p>

<h4>On long-duree vs. microhistories</h4>
<p>Again, I am on the fence.  I see value in both.</p>

<p>In the long-duree approach, history shines light granted the large, overarching themes and trends that some people find valuable. In my mind, the “History Manifesto” writers bring up some valuable points with it, especially in terms of politics. However, long-duree misses quite a bit when it comes to specifics.</p>

<p>That’s where microhistories flourish. They provide those deep dive into singular issues or events. However, those microhistories only go so far because it can be hard to find how they fit into the larger context. Take the cat massacre example. How much does that really tell the reader in terms of that time in history. It is such a radical example that it may even serve as an outlier for historical interpretation of culture.</p>

<p>Since both have their strengths and their weaknesses, both have value. I don’t think you can properly tell history without one of them. That does mean that history must be done by many people: some who focus on the long-duree and others on microhistories. That will certainly lead to more debate, but I don’t see how that is a problem. Debate is good for history and should be embraced.</p>
