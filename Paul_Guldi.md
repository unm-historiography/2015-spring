In History Manifesto, Jo Guldi and David Armitage make the argument for the return of the narrative history and the history of the longue duree. In order to really see and measure change over time it is imperative that historians take the long view. 
	
Reductionism
In their view historians with all of the twists and turns have lost sight of the function of history. Though they never explicitly state the function of history I found myself constructing a function of history. History informs us of the decisions that have gotten us into the position that we are in today. While they do not deny that history suffers from the lack of objectivity that other authors have pointed out they believe that the history must be small enough to be manageable and long enough to be of value.

Distortions
In taking the long view of history it is easy to have that view become distorted, but the same is true of micro-history. The same miniscule fact can be interpreted different ways if it looked at in isolation, but when it is viewed in relationship to other facts it becomes clearer. Guldi and Armitage are calling for a more comprehensive approach to history that will be more difficult for historians but it will be better for society.
