In this section of his book Evans discussed facts and what are historical facts. He critiqued some of the ideas that we have previously read from Carr about facts and what Carr consisted a fact. Evans says that an event is a fact but not all facts are events. He discusses in a later chapter that he believed that buildings or places. He also talks about the true distinctions of primary and secondary documents. There is a postmodernist argument that history is written by someone who is giving you his or her interpretations of a code.

Evans criticizes the uses of the word I me and my. How can those words impact what a historian is writing? Can it be useful or discredit them? 

Evans says that postmodernists ignore the real suffering. Yet they are supposed to focus more on the individual. Does this mean that postmodernist take a more philosophical approach and ignore physical traumas to participants in history? 

Evans discusses how now there are so many different specialties in history. To truly understand history must we back up and look at the whole picture like with a Monet? Or can we understand history better by focusing intensly on smaller parts.
