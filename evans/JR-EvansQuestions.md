My apologies for being a little late here. I've had a number of Daily Lobo-related things come up toward the end of the week. FYI: I'll be in Santa Fe Monday (Feb. 9) to photograph an event at the state Legislature.

How much should be be influenced by the way historians wrote before us? What I mean by that, which elements should be replicated and disgarded?

Is the real value in history to study the current human condition over trying to prevent horrible accidents in the future (i.e. the idea that those who don't learn from the future are doomed to repeat it, which I am increasingly see as a futile effort)?

How does a historian define whether a historic law is "true enough"? What factors go in to making such a decision.
