**Questions for Evans Part 1**

After I read the first part of Evans' *In Defense of History* I wondered if it was beneficial or detriminetal to history to try and tie it to sciences? Does history have to be a part of social sciences? Or, can't it just be a discourse by itself?

Also, if historians use critical analysis tools, why do they need to justify doing history as a scholarly practice when sciences use similar tools to conduct their scientific experiements and findings?
