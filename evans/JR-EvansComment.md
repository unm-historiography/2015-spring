<h2>Comment on Evans, Chapters 3-5</h2>

<p>In this passage, I found myself drawn to Evans’s discussion over facts versus evidence. There is a distinct difference between these two terms, as Evans and others correctly point out. Facts are simply that: facts. Yet what makes them evidence is the use of facts in order to prove or disprove an investigation. </p>

<p>I, for one, still cling to the idea that historians – or anyone who conducts an investigation into a matter – must let the facts and evidence dictate the opinion rather than the contrary. Any piece or pieces of evidence can be used, distorted or ignored to prove one’s theory as correct, but where truth comes from is the elimination of other theories. I still hold to the “marketplace of ideas” where the best ones will rise above the others. Here, the best theories based on the evidence will also rise over bad ones.</p>

<h4>Reasoning for this rationale</h4>

<p>Allow me to bring in some ideas I picked up in statistics (or at least what I’ve been able to understand of it): specifically, the null and alternative hypothesis. Some will call the latter the research hypothesis. It took me a long time to figure out why you reject or cannot reject the null hypothesis. Why don’t you accept the research hypothesis?</p>

<p>Then one day it clicked. You reject or cannot reject the null hypothesis because you are trying to eliminate all other possibilities to reach the truth. To prove something false is to prove the alternative is true, or you are at least closer to proving the alternative is true. This allows the evidence to dictate the results of the investigation.</p>

<p>Call me stuck in the Enlightenment here. It’s probably true. I probably am stuck in the Enlightenment</p>

<h4>Causation’s impact on evidence</h4>

<p>In our initial readings of Carr, the car accident example into causation made a lot of sense. The drunken driving and bad brakes certainly had more to do with the second man’s death much more than his smoking habit.</p>

<p>But the discussion over the evidence in Chapter 5 brought up some excellent examples. Evans refers to Appleby, Hunt and Jacobs trying to bring other facts. This discussion brings, though discussing causation, brings up the evidence points as well. Evans correctly mentions how race does not play a part in the accident when looking at the other facts.</p>

<ul>
<li>The driver tried to apply his brakes, which were faulty. If the driver deliberately tried to kill the pedestrian with his car because the driver is racist, he would not have applied the brakes. He instead would have hit the gas.</li>

<li>Also, how can a blind corner be racist? The construction team that built the infrastructure could not have deliberately made the corner blind with the intent to have a white man run down a black man. Even if that was the plan in construction, there is no way to guarantee the race of either individual, or guarantee an accident would even occur. That is the nature of an accident.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do accidents play a part in events? Of course they do. How relevant are they? That depends on which historian you ask. Clearly Carr does not believe they matter because, as Evans mentions, they are uncontrollable and thus not relevant to the causation. It’s an interesting way to look at it.</p>
