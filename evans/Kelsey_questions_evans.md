<p>1. Evans makes the arugements that historians continuously fall victim to postmodernist tactics. Do you think that historians
would be able to write history without these tactics? Do you think that postmodernism, meaning the art of writing about something
that is up for debate, defines what histotians do?</p>
<p>2. Do you think science and the postmodern idea of writing histoy are similar? Which is more concrete?</p>
<p>3. Are postmodernist historians trained and thus behave similar to scientists? Both question and create theories. Is
Evan's description of history and science true?</P>
