#The History Manifesto

##The Good
After our conversations last class I thought there would be very little redeeming quality to this work; however, I did see some important ideas that the authors brought to light. 
-The very idea of historians engaging with the current problems we face as a society (ecological crisis, political governance, and global capitalism) has started to grow on me. I think the authors present a decent argument for the ethical necessity of historians engaging in these projects (even if I don't agree with how they advocate doing so).
-The authors present a well thought out critique of fundamentalism. We are not destined by the laws of history to be capitalists or to kill our planet. These cultural myths can be subverted. (The problem here is I think that the author’s critique of fundamentalist myths can be applied to their own *long duree*) 

##The Bad… (and there’s still much) 
-The *long duree* is just a replacement of fundamentalist metanarratives. Yes, we might be able to switch out the prevailing fundamentalist myths for modern historio-ethical causal narratives. The result is just a new form of fundamentalism. The root problem is in the authors’ understanding of causality. 

##The Hope(?) 
Even after reading this work and the problem it faces I was intrigued by the solutions it provides. I think the authors’ intentions are in the right place. History and historians can have a say in the way we orient our future but it shouldn’t come by swapping one metanarrative for another. We need micro-long-durees. Historians, through the new possibilities (challenges?) presented by big data, have the opportunity to compose cultural narratives (emphasis on the plural), which seriously deal with multiple-causalities. I’m not sure what that looks like entirely yet (ask me in class tomorrow?) but this has to be the hope.
