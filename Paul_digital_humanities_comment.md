Digital Humanities

	My interaction with the concept of Digital Humanities began when 
I began reading this book. It represents a digital sensibility that is not been present in the other books we have read this semester. The differences represent what the authors refer to as computational activities. Wide spaces around the text encourage engagement with the words printed on the page, a type of digital representation in itself. Editing, thoughts, arguments, points requiring more research can all be identified in these margins. Purely digital representations accomplish this through the use of hypertext links.

Engagement

Using hypertext links rather allowing for the reader to directly engage with the material a very subtle shift occurs in the relationship between the reader and material. In a digital type print edition, or a typical print edition the relationship that exists is from the reader onto the material. Readers are generally directed to particular points with unusual typesetting fonts. This notification of a point the author believed to be important may or may not be of significance to the reader and she may continue without interruption. In purely digital texts hyperlinked sources not only direct the reader to a point the author believed important but it links the reader to the reference used by the author. This places more power in the hands of the author diminishing the importance of the reader.

What this means for History.

Readers of history will need to be more vigilant in their reading; looking for links that turn a history into a screed, or propaganda. Becoming aware of the authors biases and philosophy becomes even more critical for the reader and knowing how and where to look for other information will be key to the future of history. 

Conclusion

Marshal McLuhan's book The Medium is the Message argued that the means used to convey information has greater importance than the information itself. Rather than take up that discussion at this time I would express agreement with Professor McLuhan that the willing suspension of disbelief happens with greater ease and frequency as people relate to digital/computer generated information in ways that should be explored.
