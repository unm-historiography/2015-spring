<h2> History Curriculum

_World History_

While I completely agreed with Sally in class when she mentioned that history could be incorporated in a way that caters to the interests of different fields, I think that some form of general history is also necessary. I think there needs to be more inclusion of world history in people’s lives, even throughout grade school. It is ridiculous that since sixth grade, I had to take a total of 5 years of U.S. history, which is hardly over 200 years, and the rest of the history of humankind on this planet is relegated to the first year of Middle and High School. This also implies that one needs to be more academically advanced to learn U.S. history than world history.

_Initial Exposure at University_

Because world history is extremely important in an increasingly globalized society, there needs to be a curriculum that incorporates world history but can still fit into the three credit hour system. Maybe instead of dividing the courses by geographical region and two time periods, we divide it into three or more time periods and include all regions within the class. For example, ancient history (which is one of the most exciting subjects!!) could include the earliest civilizations i.e. before 700 B.C.E., then the next available course could be about the civilizations from 700 B.C.E. – the first few centuries C.E., and so on. Students would already have a general idea of these time periods from school before college, and then could choose one which encompasses all regions and diverse peoples to learn more about. Presenting history in this form would also address the common inability to place various historical events on a single timeline.
