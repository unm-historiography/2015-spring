#### Full circle 

I found this book, despite some political disconnect, to be thoroughly engaging throughout. It sold me on its push to ‘thinking historically’ and the significance of this for public policy reform today.  

I have to admit, this book has brought me back somewhat full circle to appreciating history on the same level I appreciate the skills it advances as a study. The information itself is more useful than I have previously given credit for. 

#### Qualms 

…”requires skills of working back and forth between past and future, discerning multiple sources of causality and ranking them, examining them from different perspectives and experiences to off the fullest possible account of how the catastrophe came to be and therefore what is owed to whom” (64)

…”we urgently need the wide-angle, long-range views only historians can provide.” (last page) 

Politics aside, the only qualm I had with this book was its assertion that history fosters research, critical thinking, and long range thinking *more than other studies. History for sure does this. But, I think this also falls into the purlieu of econ - a study that is often lumped NOT in business schools but actually in the liberal arts. 
This conclusion, dripped in examined bias (to change their phrase), and made me wonder to what extent their bias seeped into other areas of the book. Idealistic, exploitative of the advantage of hindsight, grandiose conclusions - all came to mind after realizing their ending statement wasn't accurate. 

#### Thoughts/likes  

I liked their assertion that major ideological battles these days (e.g., over climate) are i.e. over history. 

Though the logic is questionable, I thought the premise on page 73 was interesting. The authors discuss the double edged sword surrounding historical reasoning. On one hand, it can lead to change, on the other, it can be rationalized by powers at be to do nothing.  

I think the embrace of long term thinking was apt. I like micro-histories and macro-histories and like the ideas of synthesizing them. 

The notion that we can use history to critique our present isn’t novel, but the authors emphasize how critical this is. They also emphasize just how important history is in ascribing historical causation and in shaping political reform. 

I’ve thought for a while that history books should be more palatable to a general audience. And I think history books somewhat are. The problem with this is the audience, however, who I perceive to generally be attracted to sensationalized contrarian books that come out with “new information.” 

In this vein, I don’t think writing for the audience is necessarily a good thing. I just think taking complex topics and making simplifying, not dumbing down, is the goal.
