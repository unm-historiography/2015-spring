<h2>Withers summary</h2><
<p><b>Part 1 and 2</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion over the importance of space</li>
<li>Space: The physical location</li>
<li>Place: More than just space, other factors such as culture and social structures come into play.</li>
<li>Withers discusses the historiography of space, varying schools of thought.</li>
<li>Citing Relph: “The essence of place lies in the largely unselfconscious intentionality that defines place as profound centers of human existence.” (Pg. 640).</li>
<li>Citing Harvy: “Place, in whatever guise, is like space and time, a social construct. … The only interesting question that can then be asked is: by what social process(es) is place constructed?” (Pg 641).</li>
<li>Citing Malpas: “It is within the structure of place that the very possibility of the social arises (Pg 642).</li>
<li>Breaking down this debate: Does place create the social structure or do the social structure create place?</li>
<li>Withers refers to three approaches to geography: 1, descriptive; 2, social constructionist; 3, phenomenological (“human existence as being ‘in place’”) (Pg 643).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Part 3</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion regarding Agnew’s devaluation/revival argument, based on marginalization of place because of naturalization and nationalization, yet renewed interest because of globalization.</li>
<li>Withers argues social sciences, natural sciences and biological sciences are dependent on location, i.e. “ecological niche” and “habitat”.</li>
<li>Citing Carter: “Space is transformed symbolically into a place, that is, space with a history.” That local history helps create the place (Pg 647).<./li>
<li>Metaphysical distinction from Withers: place as location vs. place as locale. The latter factors in social interactions and practices in its creation.</li>
</ul>
