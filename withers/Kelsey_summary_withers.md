<p><b>With Withers the main point of his work, to me, was the discussion and distinction between place and space.</b></p>
<p><u>place:</u> a space with other factors in it.</p>
<p><u>space:</u> a physical location.</p>
With the discussion of place and space, Withers differniates how the two play distinct roles in history. History, according to Withers,
creates space and place. The factors he includes in his definition of place, refer to the cultural aspects of history. Local history,
local trends, everything past and present local, helps make this distinction between space and place for Withers.
