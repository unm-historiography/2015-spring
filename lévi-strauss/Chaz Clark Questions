+<b><h3>Questions Based Off Lévi-Strauss</p></h3>
1.) Are myth and history as closely related as  Lévi-Strauss argues? Can there be a relation of the two so close that you can
claim one is the prequel to the other?

2.) Can the three, myth, history, and science, be the sole way to look at history or is it important to take other ideas to form
new ways of thinking? Or would that cause human biases to shape hisotry instead of history shaping history?
