+<b><h3>Comments Based Off Lévi-Strauss</p></h3>
Myth, history, and science. These three, at first, seem completely unrelated in almost every sense. But Lévi-Strauss would 
disagree with that notion. He says that history started by writing down myth, and understanding myth and history is a 
science in its own. This idea that they are all intertwined is interesting, but I would be willing
to bet that most do not share the same sentiment. Although as far as believing that mthy came before history is an easy idea
to get behind. Stories are passed down from generation to generation. The cavemen with their hieroglyphics and the Greeks with
their ancient stories that we all know today are great examples to back that up.
