<h2>A comment on "Myth and Meaning"</h2>
<p>Over the course of this reading, I couldn’t help but be reminded of a quote I referenced earlier this semester. From the John Wayne-Jimmy Stewart film “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” the line from the reporter goes:<p>

<blockquote>“This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” </blockquote>

<p>This came to mind in our previous reading from de Certeau and again with Levi-Strauss, especially considering this whole collection of lectures are based upon Levi-Strauss’s ideas on myth. It calls into question the roles of myths in connection to historical truth (a question I pitched in our de Certeau, though it seems more appropriate in this selection).</p>

<h4>The role of myths: my view</h4>

<p>My previous inclination is that myth, by their very nature, cannot be brought into historical conversations unless they addressed within the context of a civilization’s belief structures. Allow me to bring my journalism experience into the fold: there is an idea in the media world that journalists engage in agenda setting. As the concept goes, the media does not necessarily tell the audience what to think, but what to think about. The role of myths is much the same. They, in my view, do not tell us factual events in history but rather value systems, faith, and understanding of the people about the world around them. </p>

<h4>A key point for historians</h4>

<p>For me, Levi-Strauss’s discussions about fragmented elements within mythology coming together in an attempt to tell a complete narrative are the most intriguing. Much like older histories, some myths have gaps in the stories, and those who study myths must find ways to juxtapose what is available into either a coherent story or deliver an incomplete collection. Yet, isn’t this what we do as historians? Don’t we take facts and compile them into a way to try to tell a “complete history”? Is such a thing even possible? </p>

<p>Levi-Strauss also points to the difference between history and mythology. In essence, Levi-Strauss says history is based on written documents while many myths are passes through an oral tradition until it reaches a point where it is written as a chronicle. Since Levi-Strauss uses many North American Indians as examples, Europeans record these myths. But even though myths are typically transmitted verbally, they could still be considered a historical fact. Levi-Strauss uses the example of an adulterous relationship with subtle changes to the facts. </p>

<p>Here are Levi-Strauss’s “explanatory cells”:</p>

<ul>
<li>Husband kills lover of his wife</li>

<li>Brothers killed their sister’s lover</li>

<li>Husband kills wife because she had a lover.</li>

</ul>

<p>This example features discrepancies in these details, yet the basic structure remains the same. Written documents could potentially have just as many issues as an oral myth could. It is our jobs, as historians, to determine which of these is truth based on available evidence. In myths, I don’t think those discrepancies matter quite as much since myths are more about the morals of the story, so to speak.</p>

<h4>One thing on e-books</h4>

<p>I have an admission to make: I messed up this reading. Well, sort of. I, for some reason, thought this selection was another article on Zotero. Turns out it was an actual book, and one that was not in the UNM bookstore at the beginning of the semester. Once I found that out, I scrambled to find a copy in town. Barnes & Noble didn’t have it. Hastings didn’t have it. No time to find a library. I did, however, find it on Google Play and bought it there.</p>

<p>After I did, I remembered an early discussion we had back on Day 2 of this semester about texts, and if an online text was “the same” than its printed counterpart. Call me old school, but I like my printed books. I always found them easier to read and digest than reading PDFs on my MacBook. So for whatever reason, probably because of that early discussion we had, I expected a radically different reading experience on my tablet.</p>

<p>Well, it’s hard to tell if I actually had a different experience than reading a hard copy. I found myself on my favorite spot on my couch in the usual reclined position, reading Levi-Strauss on my tablet. It felt different yet the same at the same time. I noticed it was a different experience, though I am at a loss to understand why as this point. </p>

<p>Maybe this is an irrelevant anecdote. Maybe it is too much of a tangent from the main topic. I found it interesting, and possibly another conversation we want to revisit before the semester ends.</p>
