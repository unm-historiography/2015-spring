There is importence to digging deep into a culture.  It allows you to find patterns and help understand.  He discusses througout the book how patterns keep showing up, and everytime I think of fractals. He seems to suggest that patterns are consisten and when you look for them, they can be found.
  
Levi-Strauss looks at studying culture through totems. 
   * in one of my sociology classes, we discussed how Emile Durkheim used totems to understand society.  It was interesting to me, to see how these two people, who both believe totems are important, and how their views are similar and different.  I can see how both ways of looking at the totem are similar. For example Levi-Strauss brings up structuralism, which is very similar to Durkheim's way he analyzes society.
    
History has replaced mythology
  * What do the myths really mean to the people
  * He also mentions that Myths were before writing, while history was after writing.  In essence, history is writing down the myth.  
  
He also mentions structuralism a lot, and the importance of looking at the larger picture and then getting smaller from their. This, along with reductionalism, made me think of the way I do history, do I do structuralism? Should I? My thoughts were that both are highly important when looking at history.
