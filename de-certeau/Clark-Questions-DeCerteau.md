<h2> Thoughts, commments, and questions from De Certeau</h2>
<ul>
<li>My initial reaction was that I was surprised this was in this class. To me, it didn't seem to fit the borders of what i felt a historiography class would teach, but that became common with this class.</li>

<h4>Questions and ideas about the reading:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Signs, Signs, Everywhere a Sign, De Certeau feels these names, these signs we assign places arent nearly as important as the cultural name we give them. I belive that he is right. The names we assign places is what makes them historical and cultural artifacts just as much as in informal name was assign art, like the Mona Lisa, or buildings, like the Empire State Building. What does the class think? are buildings documents just like a old census?</li>

<li>He talks about the power of rumors, myths, and general word of mouth in assigning value and cultural understanding to places. Does this overlook the solemnity and ceremony that officially given names can give to a place of older tradition than the somewhat short life span of word of mouth? </li>
