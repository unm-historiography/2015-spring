<h2>My burning questions from "The Practice of Everyday Life" from Michel de Certeau</h2>
<ul>
<li>First off, does this guy really have to write this way? Way too flowery (and probably a bit too full of himself), for my taste, making it hard to follow his point. Anyone agree?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Now, seriously:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Are legends history or poetry?</li>
<li>Do legends aid or inhibit historical truth?</li>
<li>Are place and space more than artifacts, or are they the same?</li>
<li>What about visuals like maps, art, photographs, etc.? Are they more than artifacts?</li>
<ul>
